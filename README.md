# WordPress Translation Cache

The WordPress gettext implementation is very slow. It uses objects that
cannot be cached into memory without reinstanting them.

pomodoro stores all seen translations as a PHP hashtable (array), that can be
subsequently stored into a file as PHP code and levereged via OPcache when loaded.

Moreover, pomodoro does lazyloading for strings that are only encountered in output.
It does not preload everything it can for a domain until there's no other choice.

## But does it really work?

We think so :)

Example on a vanilla `ru_RU` locale WordPress site:

Before:

After:

## Installation

Drop pomodoro.php into `wp-content/mu-plugins` and enjoy the added speed :)

The more plugins you have the better the performance gains.

You can use `WP_TEMP_DIR` constant to change cache directory (needs full path). Example for `wp-config.php`:
```php
define( 'WP_TEMP_DIR', dirname( $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] ) . "/tmp" );
```
